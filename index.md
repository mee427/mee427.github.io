## On 08.12.2021;

There will be no theoretical class. The practical laboratory class will be held in Prototype Lab and Sensor Systems Lab at the same time, from 13:30 to 16:10. Participitation program can be reached [here.](https://github.com/mee427/mee427.github.io/blob/master/PID%20Groups_08122021.pdf)

A document about how to build mathematical expressions in order to estimate the parameters and to extract a linear expression between reading voltage values and parameters is uploaded and can be reached [here.](https://github.com/mee427/mee427.github.io/blob/master/SummaryForModels.pdf) Before getting into Question 5 in your regular lab sheet, you should finish this part, which is pretty straightforward.

In order to check if your serial communication works properly, you should upload [supplied code 2](https://github.com/mee427/ccs-c-codes/blob/master/SuppliedCode_2.c) to your microcontroller and test it with serial communication interface.

If the communication works properly, you can upload [code piece for estimating rotational inertia](https://github.com/mee427/ccs-c-codes/blob/master/EstimateJ.c) and save your output data via serial communication interface.

## An update is done about current filter and estimating torque constant procedure!

Updated version document is [here](https://github.com/mee427/mee427.github.io/blob/master/PID%20Modelling_Update.pdf) and the updates can be seen in yellow highlights.

## On 01.12.2021;

Theoretical and practical classes together will be held at the same time. Students will join the classes according to sections.

### Section #2 groups;

*will join the theoretical class in C1-05 at 13:30

*will join the laboratory class in Prototype Lab at 14:45

### Section #1 groups;

*will join the laboratory class in Prototype Lab at 13:30

*will join the theoretical class in C1-05 at 14:45
